-   **Info unavailable:** Private messages, request numbers and acceptances/denials.
-   **Questions:** How many members are freeloaders? What traits correspond to reviews? How often is a bad review the last event? What proportion of reviews are bad? Where are the most frequent hosts located and where are the most frequent travelers from?
